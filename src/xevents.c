      called only from birth. If child has no father AND random_father
      is TRUE-- then we need to find one in order to give the kids
      some dna. Since all living people are on the event queue, we'll
      choose from there and take the first living male with age >=
      random_father_min_age.

      we will select a month at random and then check each person
      scheduled for an even in that month in random order. It turns
      out that the event_queue is stored in person_id order so we have
      to select at random from within the month.

      We'll call marriage_allowable to toss out incest and whatever else
      makes marriage inaddmissable EXCEPT present marital status
