# socsim-dev
Pre-release development site for Socsim. 

## This site will start out with Socsim as it exists at Berkeley August 2019.  The plan is to remove extraneous obsolete code; improve comments and documentation and then to start a new public site with clean simple and inviting version of Socsim for eager scientists.
