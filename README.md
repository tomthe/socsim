# socsim-dev
Pre-release development site for Socsim. 

## Todo

### next

* make this readme a little bit less embarrassing
* test: does it still work on linux? (yes!)
* improve socsim-oversimplified.md untill it reflects everything in the pdf
* clean the repository
* improve the makefile so things are clear

* write r-code to test some simulations and wether they still have the same results as they should
* provide packages and installing instructions
* populate the socsim-course repository (add a readme )

### someday in the future

* create an R-package
  * with windows and linux binaries
  * maybe with some extra-functions to read the output-files
* find out why the c++-version on Windows segfaults
* remove unused code
  * census?


### This site will start out with Socsim as it exists at Berkeley August 2019.  The plan is to remove extraneous obsolete code; improve comments and documentation and then to start a new public site with clean simple and inviting version of Socsim for eager scientists.

## (further) Documentation

The documentation is not complete yet (give us another 50 years), but can be found here: ... (maybe something like readthedocs.com ?)

look at the [example projects](http://github.molgen.mpg.de/cmason/socsimsamples) which are extensively commented. It's like a tutorial.

There's also [SOCSIM Oversimplified](https://lab.demog.berkeley.edu/socsim/CurrentDocs/socsimOversimplified.pdf) to get a somewhat deeper understanding of the underlying stuff.
