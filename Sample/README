For the simplest socsim simulation run this:

/path/to/socsim sample.sup 13531

then compare the md5sum of the files in SimResults
with those in  SimResults/md5sum.seed13531

Or better yet -- visit the Rcode directory first and look at
sample.R  -- that file has code to run the simulation from within R
and to read the results and reproduce some of the simulation parameters.
