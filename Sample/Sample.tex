\section{Sample Socsim Simulation}

This project is an introduction to microsimulation using Socsim. Using
the code provided you will run a socsim simulation and then recover
several of the rates and simulation parameters specified in the .sup
file and the various included ratefiles. Unlike the other socsim
exercises, this one has no sensible underlying story -- and thus the
rates and simulation parameters are in no way sacred.  The purpose of
this exercise  is
simply to introduce a few of socsim's many features and to give you
permission and confidence to both try stuff and break stuff.


The goals of this adventure are:
\begin{itemize}

\item To demystify socsim at least a little bit
\item To understand the structure of Socsim's output files (opop and omar)
\item To understand a few of the many parameters that control socsim's behavior.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Setup}
\label{Setup}

If you are in Belo Horizonte and it is August 2013, then both R and
socsim already set up for you and you can safely ignore the rest of
this section.   We will discuss in class how
to configure stuff to do science most efficiently.  Hopefully, this
will involve running the simulations on the demog.berkeley.edu servers
but analyzing the results on the local machines at CEDEPLAR.  


\textbf{In order to do the complete exercise}, it will be necessary to
have a running recent version of Socsim and a recent version of R, a
software environment for statistical computing and graphics. R is free
and wonderful.  Visit \url{http://www.r-project.org/} if you do not
already have R.  You will also need to have the R package ``survival''
installed. Try \user{load(survival)} first, if that fails then try
\user{install.packages(survival)}, if that fails either write your own
hazard analysis packages or see your system/administrator.  It is
possible to do this exercise with software other than R, but you will
need some understanding of R in order to translate the sample code.



See \url{http://lab.demog.berkeley.edu/socsim} if you still need to get
Socsim running.  The tar file referenced below does contain a sample
of Socsim output so if you would like to learn about Socsim without
actually running it, you can just do the R part of the exercise. 

\subsection{The \user{ Sample} directory}
\label{sec:running-socsim-1}


All of the Socsim files for this exercise are available in a directory
called \user{Sample} which you can download as a compressed tar file
from \url{http://lab.demog.berkeley.edu/socsim/Sample.tgz}.  This
directory contains files called \user{sample.sup} \user{ratefile.min}
which together contain all of the instructions necessary find it's
initial population and run a very simple simulation.

The simplicity of this simulation is obscured by a large number of
comments within the .sup file.  These comments (indicated by a leading
'*' are ignored by socsim but should read carefully by humans wishing
to understand what is going on. Some of the comments explain what the
directives mean and others are alternative directives that socsim
could understand and act upon if the '*' were removed.

More information is available in the \emph{Socsim Oversimplified} document which you should have access to.


The \user{Sample} directory layout is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:Dir}. Notice that all of the R code is contained in a
directory called \user{Rcode}. Notice also that results of this
simulation will be stored in a directory called \user{SimResults}.
The \user{SimResults} directory is already populated with the results
of a simulation run. When you run socsim yourself, these files will be
silently over-written. If you don't feel like running socsim, you can
start instead by analyzing these pre cooked files instead.

In general, we should be careful where we write socsim results. In
real science, socsim output files are both large and easily
reproduced, consequently, it is best to write socsim output to cheap
unbacked up disks. We'll be more careful in subsequent exercises.

\subsection{Socsim instructions}

Have a look at the \user{sample.sup} file and notice the following
things: 

\begin{description}

\item [There are lots of comments] comments are indicated by the '*'
  character.  In addition to comments intended for humans, there are
  also many variants of directives that are commented out.  You may
  wish to experiment by uncommenting these lines.  But first run
  socsim as it is -- otherwise some of the code in \user{sample.r}
  will make no sense.

\item[There is only one simulation segment] The first directive in the
  file is : \user{segments 1}. A simulation segment is a period of
  simulated months wherein a single set of vital rates is in
  effect. Most simulations have more than one segment, but not this
  one.


\item[The file contains some Unix commands] It is possible to run Unix
  commands from the .sup file. The \user{execute} directive is for
  this. We do fairly simple things like creating directories, but it
  is possible to do much more complicated things such as modifying the
  rates set (that is about to be read) based on the outcome of a
  previous simulation segment.

\item[Mortality and fertility rates in distinct files.] The
  \user{include} directive instructs Socsim to start reading the
  directives from a different file and then continue in the present
  file the directives in the included file have been processed.  Our
  convention is to put vital rates in included files and we have done
  so here, but this is not necessary. Any socsim directive can be read
  from an included file.

\item[The simulation starts when the run command is read] Because
  there is only one segment, there is only one run command in this
  file. When socsim encounters the \user{run} directive, it runs the
  segment and then returns to processing the .sup file. One
  consequence of this is that errors in the .sup file can go unnoticed
  until late in the simulation.

\end{description}

\subsection{Run the simulation}


To run the simulation cd into the \user{Sample} directory
(that you may have produced by unpacking the Sample.tgz file). 

then type:

\cmd{\/path\/to\/Socsim sample.sup 13531}

where the ``13531'' is an arbitrary number that serves as random
number seed. 

\voc{/path/to/socsim} means the full filename of the executable that
you compiled earlier.


If all goes well a bunch of now familiar stuff will scroll onto the
screen indicating how things are going with the simulation.  Output
will be stored in the \user{SimResults} directory.  Results consist of
\user{SimResults/sample.opop}, \user{SimResults/sample.omar} and three
other files that are in the present case either unimportant or empty
or both.

Files with the \voc{.opop} suffix contain the population list, files
with the \voc{.omar} suffix contain the marriage list. These two files
will be read and analyzed in \user{sample.r}.



\subsection{Analyzing simulation output: sample.r}

In the sub directory \user{Rcode} you'll find a file called
\user{sample.r} That file contains R instructions for reading the
simulation output (the \voc{.opop} and \voc{.omar} files) and for
recovering some of the rates and parameters specified in the
\voc{.sup} file.  \user{sample.r} also contains some code for running
the simulation from within R.  If you have been a good student, then
you have already run the simulation and do not need to do so again --
but as you investigate the data and make changes to the \voc{.sup}
file, it will be convenient to \emph{re-run} the simulation from the
comfort of your R session.

After working through the sample calculations, there is a list of
suggested extensions that you might wish to pursue.  You are
encouraged to think of other, more interesting things to do instead.
The idea is to become familiar with Socsim's habits and the ways in
which you can effect it.  

Because Socsim is a work in progress, relatively little pre-simulation
checking is done of either the rates or the parameters.  It is
perfectly possible--intentionally or unintentionally-- to make Socsim
do things that do not make a lot of sense. You can, for example,
easily specify fertility and mortality rates that make the population
explode or die off. You can specify that only females are born. You
can also specify rates that are greater than 1.0 -- which can lead to
individuals having an infinite number of events in a single month.  In
most cases Socsim will either grind to a halt (too many events or
people) or speed up and finish (too few).  In some cases it will
also crash with a cryptic message like ``segmentation fault''.  None
of these eventualities will cause any lasting harm to the universe,
but in the case of crashes, the cause can be difficult to
determine. So it goes.  In the case of infinite loops, it is best to hit Ctrl+C
in the terminal window where socsim is running (or just killing the
terminal window).  Either procedure kills the socsim process which
left alone will fill up disks and exhaust the world's supply of electrons.
