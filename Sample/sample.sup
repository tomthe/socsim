************************************************************************
*  This file runs a very simple one segment simulation with all nearly
*  all directives set to default values.  
*  
*  In the Rcode subdirectory there should be program called
*  example.r that will read the output of this simulation and
*  recover the effects of the rates and directives herein
** type [path to socsim] run.sup 12345

************************************************************************

** number of simulation segments to execute
segments 1

**stem of input files implies start4grp.opop and start4grp.omar
input_file start4grp
**input_file start.5k

** A possible use of execute is to create a directory for results
**(you may wish to comment this out or change it if you don't have
** a /72hours directory or if $USER does not resolve to something useful
** NOTE that if the directory exists you will get an error message 
** which you can generally ignore.

execute "test -d SimResults || mkdir SimResults"

** stem of output file it is wise to write output files into a sep folder
** NOTE that this spec depends on the previous execute directive
** so if you get rid of that, modify this too
output_file SimResults/sample


** duration of first simulation segment
duration 4500
** minimum interval in months between births
*bint 9
** heterogeneous fertility enabled
*hetfert 1
hetfert 0
** inheritance of fertility multiplier defined by alpha/beta (disabled by def)
** alpha == 1; beta==1 ==> complete inheritance 
**  0<alpha<1
*alpha 0
*beta  1
** proportion of births which are male
*proportion_male .5112
** synonym for proporion_male: sex_ratio 

** read the file of "extra" characteristics--only used by enhanced versions
**read_xtra
** how many extra characteristics to read -- ONLY for enhanced versions
**size_of_xtra

** assign random males to be fathers if mother is unmarried
random_father 1
** minimum age of randomly assigned fathers
*random_father_min_age 15

** propensity to marry across groups. defaults to 0 = group
** is NOT considered in evaluation of marriages; -1 = complete exogamy
** 1= complete endogamy
*endogamy 0


** Evaluate marriages by "preference" or "distribution"
*marriage_eval  preference
marriage_eval  distribution



** For marriage evaluation based on age-difference "preference" 
** most preferred marriage age difference
*marriage_peak_age 2
** male older preferred 2x as female older matches
*marriage_slope_ratio 2
** maximum age difference allowed
*marriage_agedif_max 1200
** minimum age difference allowed
*marriage_agedif_min -1200
** For marriage evaluation based on age-difference "distribution" 
** specify for each group in simulation
*agedif_marriage_mean (group) 2
agedif_marriage_mean 1 2
*agedif_marriage_sd (group) 3
agedif_marriage_sd 1 3



** One or Two marriage queue system
*marriage_queues 2
marriage_queues 1



** group inheritance at birth: from_father from_mother 
** from_same_sex_parent or from_opposite_sex_parent
*child_inherits_group from_father

** parameter hooks for enhanced versions unused in standard Socsim
*parameter1
*parameter2
*parameter3
*parameter4
*parameter5


** Insert the contents of another file right here
include ratefile.min

** Write opop,omar etc after this segment. 
** files will be written after last segment regardless
*write_output 0

** Stop processing this file and run the simulation
