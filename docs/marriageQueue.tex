\label{sec:marriageQueue}

Marriage are greatly complicated by the need for two spouses.  When a
27 year old female's marriage event comes up, there must be a suitable
male waiting or else that marriage cannot be executed on time.
Conversely \emph{if there is} a suitable male waiting, then his
marriage event was probably scheduled to have taken place previously.  

As a consequence, it is often necessary to ``tune'' marriage rates in
order to acheive desired marriage rates.
